    "## Examining the Impact of Institutional, Demographic, and Socioeconomic Factors on On-Time Graduation Rates in Universities of the DMV Area\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "On-time graduation rates are a critical metric for assessing the effectiveness of higher education institutions and their ability to foster academic success across diverse student populations. In the DMV (District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia) area, a unique blend of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), predominantly white institutions (PWIs), and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs) offers an interesting landscape to study how various factors shape graduation outcomes. The region is characterized by diverse demographic and socioeconomic profiles, and understanding how these factors intersect with institutional characteristics can shed light on persistent disparities in educational attainment.\n",
    "This research explores how university type, student demographics, and external factors such as housing availability, student employment, and commute times influence on-time graduation rates at universities in the DMV area. By analyzing these elements, this study seeks to identify trends and systemic barriers that may disproportionately affect certain student groups, particularly racial/ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged students. Additionally, by investigating the relationship between institutional resources, regional demographics, and student success, this research aims to provide insights that can inform policy changes and strategies for improving graduation outcomes for all students in the DMV area.\n",

    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "On-time graduation rates in universities across the DMV area exhibit disparities that may be influenced by factors such as institution type (HBCUs, PWIs, MSIs), demographic characteristics, and socioeconomic barriers. While higher education institutions are key to promoting social mobility, systemic issues such as access to housing, student employment, and regional disparities may affect graduation outcomes. This research seeks to explore the underlying causes of fluctuating graduation rates by examining enrollment trends, degree completion data, and demographic factors, with a specific focus on how disparities in race, gender, and socioeconomic background contribute to variations in on-time graduation rates. Additionally, by exploring external factors such as commute times and student employment, this study aims to identify key variables that may be impacting educational attainment across universities in the DMV area, and how these factors align with broader regional demographic trends.\n",

    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tHow do on-time graduation rates differ across HBCUs, PWIs, and MSIs in the DMV area?\n",
    "2.\tWhat is the impact of demographic factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender) on on-time graduation rates at universities in the DMV area?\n",
    "3.\tHow do the availability of on-campus housing and commute distances influence on-time graduation rates at universities in the DMV area without on-campus housing options?\n",
    "4.\tTo what extent do systemic factors such as reduced funding and generational wealth disparities effect on-time graduation rates for students at universities in the DMV area?\n",

    "### Literature Review: \n",
    "Graduation rates, particularly timely graduation, are crucial indicators of higher education effectiveness. However, underrepresented student populations, including racial/ethnic minorities and low-income students, face unique challenges that often prevent them from graduating on time. As Creighton (2007) notes, low graduation rates reflect a university's inability to meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of students. Underrepresented students often leave due to personal challenges, job demands, dissatisfaction with the academic environment, and a disconnect between their values and the campus culture. These challenges are further exacerbated by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, making timely graduation even more difficult for these populations.\n",
    "Tentsho, McNeil, and Tongkumchum (2019) provide additional insights into factors affecting timely graduation, such as academic performance, faculty support, and living conditions. Their study highlights that first-semester GPA, faculty quality, gender, and place of residence are critical predictors of timely graduation. Students with higher first-semester GPAs and those in faculties with more academic support were more likely to graduate within four years. Gender differences also emerged, with female students generally graduating on time at higher rates than male students. Furthermore, students residing on-campus were more likely to graduate on time compared to those commuting, likely due to better access to academic resources and a stronger sense of community.\n",
    "The Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education (2004) focuses on the barriers faced by low-income students. The study identifies that factors such as financial aid, academic support, mentoring programs, and a culture of high expectations play crucial roles in fostering retention and timely graduation. Institutions with higher graduation rates for low-income students emphasize strong financial aid packages and provide intensive academic support services. Additionally, mentorship programs that connect students with faculty or peers help foster a sense of belonging and support, which is critical for persistence. These institutional practices are integral to ensuring that low-income students remain on track for timely graduation.\n",
    "Building on this, Letkiewicz, Lim, and Montalto (2016) conducted a study using data from the 2010 Ohio Student Financial Wellness Survey, which examined the influence of sociological and economic factors on students’ expected time-to-degree. The study found that personal financial characteristics—such as overspending, having car loans, credit card debt, and high levels of financial stress—significantly contributed to taking longer than four years to complete an undergraduate degree. Financial stress can create distractions that detract from academic focus, making it harder for students to persist. However, students who lived or worked on campus, maintained a high GPA, or engaged with financial counselors were more likely to graduate on time. This study underscores the importance of financial wellness and campus engagement in facilitating timely graduation.\n",
    "Similarly, Creighton (2007) addresses the challenges faced by racial and ethnic minority groups, including African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian Pacific American students. African American students often experience academic and social marginalization, while Hispanic students may encounter financial instability and language barriers. APA students face high expectations, leading to burnout and pressure, while Native American students often lack culturally responsive support, which can affect their academic persistence.\n",
    "The research by Letkiewicz et al. (2016) expands on this by suggesting that students' financial decisions and stress levels are key determinants of whether they will finish their degree on time. Their findings indicate that students who are able to manage their finances better and seek financial counseling are more likely to graduate within the expected time frame. In addition to this, the study highlights the importance of the college environment. Students who feel supported by their institutions and can engage in campus life are more likely to meet graduation deadlines.\n",
    "To address these barriers, universities must adopt comprehensive approaches, such as providing financial literacy programs, on-campus housing, and mentoring for underrepresented students. Tentsho et al. (2019) suggest that universities should intervene early to support students struggling academically, particularly those who may not perform well in their first semester. Furthermore, the Pell Institute (2004) emphasizes the need for targeted financial aid and academic support services that cater to low-income students.\n",
    "In conclusion, improving timely graduation rates, especially for underrepresented student populations, requires a multifaceted approach that considers financial, academic, and socio-cultural factors. The research findings from Tentsho et al. (2019), Letkiewicz et al. (2016), and Muraskin & Lee (2004) emphasize that factors such as first-semester GPA, financial stress, financial aid, and campus engagement all play crucial roles in determining whether students will graduate on time. By addressing these factors, universities can create a more supportive environment that enables underrepresented students to succeed and complete their degrees within the expected time frame.\n",
